The solution involves avoiding the combination of `:has()` and `:not()` and instead using a more reliable approach that leverages the `:empty` pseudo-class:

```css
.container:empty {
  background-color: lightblue;
}
.item {
  background-color: lightcoral;
}
```

This revised code directly targets empty containers, ensuring consistent and predictable results across different browsers.  The `:empty` pseudo-class is well-supported and accurately identifies elements without any children. This removes the ambiguity and inconsistent behavior associated with the `:has(:not())` combination.
