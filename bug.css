The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the `:has()` pseudo-class in combination with the `:not()` pseudo-class:

```css
.container:has(:not(.item)) {
  background-color: lightblue;
}
.item {
  background-color: lightcoral;
}
```

This code intends to style the `.container` element only if it does not contain any elements with the class `item`. However, this specific combination can lead to unexpected behavior in some browsers due to the interaction between `:has()` and `:not()`.  The selector may not accurately identify containers lacking `.item` elements. This can result in incorrect styling or unexpected layout.

The root of the problem lies in how some browsers interpret the negation within the `:has()` context. The intended behavior might not be consistently implemented.
